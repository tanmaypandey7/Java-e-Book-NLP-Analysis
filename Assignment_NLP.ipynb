              "'Java Basics\\n\\nJava Basics\\n\\nTopics in this section include:\\n\\n•  What makes Java programs portable, secure, and robust\\n\\n•  The structure of Java applets and applications\\n\\n•  How Java applications are executed\\n\\n•  How applets are invoked and executed\\n\\n•  The Java Language, Part I\\n\\n•  Comments\\n\\n•  Declarations\\n\\n•  Expressions\\n\\n•  Statements\\n\\n•  Garbage collection\\n\\n•  Java Semantics\\n\\nPortability\\n\\nJava programs are portable across operating systems and hardware environments.\\nPortability is to your advantage because:\\n\\n•  You need only one version of your software to serve a broad market.\\n\\n•  The Internet, in effect, becomes one giant, dynamic library.\\n\\n•  You are no longer limited by your particular computer platform.\\n\\nThree features make Java String programs portable:\\n\\n1.  The language. The Java language is completely specified; all data-type sizes and\\n\\nformats are defined as part of the language. By contrast, C/C++ leaves these\\n\"details\" up to the compiler implementor, and many C/C++ programs therefore\\n\\n© 1996-2003 jGuru.com. All Rights Reserved.\\n\\nJava Basics -1\\n\\n\\x0cJava Basics\\n\\nare not portable.\\n\\n2.  The library. The Java class library is available on any machine with a Java\\n\\nruntime system, because a portable program is of no use if you cannot use the\\nsame class library on every platform. Window-manager function calls in a Mac\\napplication written in C/C++, for example, do not port well to a PC.\\n\\n3.  The byte code. The Java runtime system does not compile your source code\\ndirectly into machine language, an inflexible and nonportable representation of\\nyour program. Instead, Java programs are translated into machine-independent\\nbyte code. The byte code is easily interpreted and therefore can be executed on\\nany platform having a Java runtime system. (The latest versions of the Netscape\\nNavigator browser, for example, can run applets on virtually any platform).\\n\\nSecurity\\n\\nThe Java language is secure in that it is very difficult to write incorrect code or\\nviruses that can corrupt/steal your data, or harm hardware such as hard disks.\\nThere are two main lines of defense:\\n\\n• \\n\\nInterpreter level:\\n\\n•  No pointer arithmetic\\n\\n•  Garbage collection\\n\\n•  Array bounds checking\\n\\n•  No illegal data conversions\\n\\n•  Browser level (applies to applets only):\\n\\n•  No local file I/O\\n\\n•  Sockets back to host only\\n\\n•  No calls to native methods\\n\\nRobustness\\n\\nThe Java language is robust. It has several features designed to avoid crashes\\nduring program execution, including:\\n\\n•  No pointer arithmetic\\n\\nJava Basics -2\\n\\n© 1996-2003 jGuru.com. All Rights Reserved.\\n\\n\\x0cJava Basics\\n\\n•  Garbage collection--no bad addresses\\n\\n•  Array and string bounds checking\\n\\n•  No jumping to bad method addresses\\n\\n• \\n\\nInterfaces and exceptions\\n\\nJava Program Structure\\n\\nA file containing Java source code is considered a compilation unit. Such a\\ncompilation unit contains a set of classes and, optionally, a package definition to\\ngroup related classes together. Classes contain data and method members that\\nspecify the state and behavior of the objects in your program.\\n\\nJava programs come in two flavors:\\n\\n•  Standalone applications that have no initial context such as a pre-existing main\\n\\nwindow\\n\\n•  Applets for WWW programming\\n\\nThe major differences between applications and applets are:\\n\\n•  Applets are not allowed to use file I/O and sockets (other than to the host\\n\\nplatform). Applications do not have these restrictions.\\n\\n•  An applet must be a subclass of the Java Applet class. Aplications do not need to\\n\\nsubclass any particular class.\\n\\n•  Unlike applets, applications can have menus.\\n\\n•  Unlike applications, applets need to respond to predefined lifecycle messages\\n\\nfrom the WWW browser in which they\\'re running.\\n\\nJava Program Execution\\n\\nThe Java byte-code compiler translates a Java source file into machine-\\nindependent byte code. The byte code for each publicly visible class is placed in a\\nseparate file, so that the Java runtime system can easily find it. If your program\\ninstantiates an object of class A, for example, the class loader searches the\\ndirectories listed in your CLASSPATH environment variable for a file called A.class\\nthat contains the class definition and byte code for class A.\\n\\nThere is no link phase for Java programs; all linking is done dynamically at\\n\\n© 1996-2003 jGuru.com. All Rights Reserved.\\n\\nJava Basics -3\\n\\n\\x0cJava Basics\\n\\nruntime.\\n\\nThe following diagram shows an example of the Java compilation and execution\\nsequence for a source file named A.java containing public class A and non-public\\nclass B:\\n\\nJava programs are, in effect, distributed applications. You may think of them as a\\ncollection of DLLs (dynamically loadable libraries) that are linked on demand at\\nruntime. When you write your own Java applications, you will often integrate\\n\\nyour program with already-existing portions of code that reside on other\\n\\nmachines.\\n\\nA Simple Application\\n\\nConsider the following trivial application that prints \"hi there\" to standard\\noutput:\\n\\nJava Basics -4\\n\\n© 1996-2003 jGuru.com. All Rights Reserved.\\n\\n\\x0cJava Basics\\n\\npublic class TrivialApplication {\\n  // args[0] is first argument\\n  // args[1] the second\\n  public static void main(String args[]) {\\n    System.out.println(\"hi there\");\\n  }\\n}\\nThe command java TrivialApplication tells the Java runtime system to begin\\nwith the class file TrivialApplication.class and to look in that file for a\\nmethod with the signature:\\n\\npublic static void main(String args[]);\\nThe main() method will always reside in one of your class files. The Java\\nlanguage does not allow methods outside of class definitions. The class, in effect,\\ncreates scoped symbol StartingClassName.main for your main() method.\\n\\nApplet  Execution\\n\\nAn applet is a Java program that runs within a Java-compatible WWW browser or\\nin an appletviewer. To execute your applet, the browser:\\n\\n•  Creates an instance of your applet\\n\\n•  Sends messages to your applet to automatically invoke predefined lifecycle\\n\\nmethods\\n\\nThe predefined methods automatically invoked by the runtime system are:\\n\\n•  init(). This method takes the place of the Applet constructor and is only called\\nonce during applet creation. Instance variables should be initialized in this method.\\nGUI components such as buttons and scrollbars should be added to the GUI in\\nthis method.\\n\\n•  start(). This method is called once after init() and whenever your applet is\\nrevisited by your browser, or when you deiconify your browser. This method\\nshould be used to start animations and other threads.\\n\\n•  paint(Graphics g). This method is called when the applet drawing area needs\\nto be redrawn. Anything not drawn by contained components must be drawn in\\nthis method. Bitmaps, for example, are drawn here, but buttons are not because\\nthey handle their own painting.\\n\\n•  stop(). This method is called when you leave an applet or when you iconify\\n\\nyour browser. The method should be used to suspend animations and other\\n\\n© 1996-2003 jGuru.com. All Rights Reserved.\\n\\nJava Basics -5\\n\\n\\x0cJava Basics\\n\\nthreads so they do not burden system resources unnecessarily. It is guaranteed to\\nbe called before destroy().\\n\\n•  destroy(). This method is called when an applet terminates, for example, when\\n\\nquitting the browser. Final clean-up operations such as freeing up system\\nresources with dispose() should be done here. The dispose() method of Frame\\nremoves the menu bar. Therefore, do not forget to call super.dispose() if you\\noverride the default behavior.\\n\\nThe basic structure of an applet that uses each of these predefined methods is:\\n\\nimport java.applet.Applet;\\n// include all AWT class definitions\\nimport java.awt.*;\\n\\npublic class AppletTemplate extends Applet {\\n  public void init() {\\n    // create GUI, initialize applet\\n  }\\n  public void start() {\\n    // start threads, animations etc...\\n  }\\n  public void paint(Graphics g) {\\n    // draw things in g\\n  }\\n  public void stop() {\\n    // suspend threads, stop animations etc...\\n  }\\n  public void destroy() {\\n    // free up system resources, stop threads\\n  }\\n}\\nAll you have to do is fill in the appropriate methods to bring your applet to life. If\\nyou don\\'t need to use one or more of these predefined methods, simply leave them\\nout of your applet. The applet will ignore messages from the browser attempting\\nto invoke any of these methods that you don\\'t use.\\n\\nA Simple Applet\\n\\nThe following complete applet displays \"Hello, World Wide Web!\" in your\\nbrowser window:\\n\\nimport java.applet.Applet;\\nimport java.awt.Graphics;\\n\\npublic class TrivialApplet extends Applet {\\n  public void paint(Graphics g) {\\n    // display a string at 20,20\\n\\nJava Basics -6\\n\\n© 1996-2003 jGuru.com. All Rights Reserved.\\n\\n\\x0cJava Basics\\n\\n    // where 0,0 is the upper-left corner\\n    g.drawString(\"Hello, World Wide Web!\", 20, 20);\\n  }\\n}\\nAn appletviewer may be used instead of a WWW browser to test applets. For\\nexample, the output of TrivialApplet on an appletviewer looks like:\\n\\nHTML/Applet  Interface\\n\\nThe HTML applet tag is similar to the HTML img tag, and has the form:\\n\\n<applet code=AppletName.class width=w height=h>\\n[parameters]\\n</applet>\\nwhere the optional parameters are a list of parameter definitions of the form:\\n\\n<param name=n value=v>\\nAn example tag with parameter definitions is:\\n\\n<applet code=AppletName.class width=300 height=200>\\n<param name=p1 value=34>\\n<param name=p2 value=\"test\">\\n</applet>\\nwhere p1 and p2 are user-defined parameters.\\n\\nThe code, width, and height parameters are mandatory. The parameters\\ncodebase, alt, archives, align, vspace, and hspace are optional within the\\n<applet> tag itself. Your applet can access any of these parameters by calling:\\n\\nApplet.getParameter(\"p\")\\nwhich returns the String value of the parameter. For example, the applet:\\n\\nimport java.applet.Applet;\\n\\npublic class ParamTest extends Applet {\\n  public void init() {\\n    System.out.println(\"width is \" + getParameter(\"width\"));\\n    System.out.println(\"p1 is \"    + getParameter(\"p1\"));\\n\\n© 1996-2003 jGuru.com. All Rights Reserved.\\n\\nJava Basics -7\\n\\n\\x0cJava Basics\\n\\n    System.out.println(\"p2 is \"    + getParameter(\"p2\"));\\n  }\\n}\\nprints the following to standard output:\\n\\nwidth is 300\\np1 is 34\\np2 is test\\n\\nComments\\n\\nJava comments are the same as C++ comments, i.e.,\\n\\n/* C-style block comments */\\nwhere all text between the opening /* and closing */ is ignored, and\\n\\n// C++ style single-line comments\\nwhere all text from the opening // to the end of the line is ignored.\\n\\nNote that these two comments can make a very useful combination. C-style\\ncomments (/* ... */) cannot be nested, but can contain C++ style comments.\\nThis leads to the interesting observation that if you always use C++-style\\ncomments (// ...), you can easily comment out a section of code by surrounding\\nit with C-style comments. So try to use C++ style comments for your \"normal\"\\ncode commentary, and reserve C-style comments for commenting out sections of\\ncode.\\n\\nThe Java language also has a document comment:\\n\\n/** document comment */\\nThese comments are processed by the javadoc program to generate\\ndocumentation from your source code. For example,\\n\\n/** This class does blah blah blah */\\nclass Blah {\\n  /** This method does nothing\\n  /**\\n   * This is a multiple line comment.\\n   * The leading * is not placed in documentation.\\n   */\\n  public void nothing() {;}\\n}\\n\\nJava Basics -8\\n\\n© 1996-2003 jGuru.com. All Rights Reserved.\\n\\n\\x0cJava Basics\\n\\nDeclarations\\n\\nA Java variable may refer to an object, an array, or an item of primitive type.\\nVariables are defined using the following simple syntax:\\n\\nTypeName variableName;\\nFor example,\\n\\nint a;     // defines an integer\\nint[] b;   // defines a reference to array of ints\\nVector v;  // reference to a Vector object\\n\\nPrimitive Types\\n\\nThe Java language has the following primitive types:\\n\\nPrimitive Types\\n\\nPrimitive Type\\n\\nDescription\\n\\nboolean\\n\\ntrue/false\\n\\nbyte\\n\\nchar\\n\\nshort\\n\\nint\\n\\nlong\\n\\nfloat\\n\\ndouble\\n\\n8 bits\\n\\n16 bits (UNICODE)\\n\\n16 bits\\n\\n32 bits\\n\\n64 bits\\n\\n32 bits IEEE 754-1985\\n\\n64 bits IEEE 754-1985\\n\\nJava int types may not be used as boolean types and are always signed.\\n\\nObjects\\n\\nA simple C++ object or C struct definition such as \"Button b;\" allocates\\nmemory on the stack for a Button object and makes b refer to it. By contrast, you\\nmust specifically instantiate Java objects with the new operator. For example,\\n\\n© 1996-2003 jGuru.com.

These primitive types are provided in addition to object types\\npurely for efficiency. An int is much more efficient than an Integer.\\n\\nJava Basics -10\\n\\n© 1996-2003 jGuru.com.

For variable-length strings, use\\nStringBuffer objects.\\n\\nStrings may be concatenated by using the plus operator:\\n\\nString s = \"one\" + \"two\"; // s == \"onetwo\"\\nYou may concatenate any object to a string. You use the toString() method to\\nconvert objects to a String, and primitive types are converted by the compiler.\\nFor example,\\n\\nString s = \"1+1=\" + 2; // s == \"1+1=2\"\\nThe length of a string may be obtained with String method length(); e.g.,\\n\"abc\".length() has the value 3.\\n\\nTo convert an int to a String, use:\\n\\nString s = String.valueOf(4);\\nTo convert a String to an int, use:\\n\\nint a = Integer.parseInt(\"4\");\\n\\nArray Objects\\n\\nIn C and C++, arrays are pointers to data in memory.

A proper Java statement is:\\n\\nJava Basics\\n\\n// Java code\\nnew T().method();\\nIn C++, you would use:\\n\\n// C++ code\\n\\n(new T)->method();\\n\\nStatements\\n\\nJava statements are similar to those in C/C++ as the following table shows.\\n\\nForms of Common Statements\\n\\nStatement\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nif\\n\\nswitch\\n\\nfor\\n\\nwhile\\n\\nif (boolean-expr) stat1\\nif (boolean-expr) stat1 else stat2\\n\\nswitch (int-expr) {\\ncase int-const-expr : stat1\\ncase int-const-expr : stat2\\ndefault : stat3\\n}\\n\\nfor (int i=0; i<10; i++) stat\\n\\nwhile (boolean-expr) stat\\n\\ndo-while\\n\\ndo { stats } while (boolean-expr)\\n\\nreturn\\n\\nreturn expr;\\n\\nThe Java break and continue statements may have labels. These labels refer to\\nthe specific loop that the break or continue apply to. (Each loop can be\\npreceded by a label.)\\n\\nJava  Semantics\\n\\nWe say that the Java language has \"reference semantics\" and C/C++ have \"copy\\nsemantics.\" This means that Java objects are passed to methods by reference in\\nJava, while objects are passed by value in C/C++.\\n\\nJava primitive types, however, are not treated in the same way as Java objects.\\nPrimitive types are assigned, compared, and passed as arguments using copy\\n\\n© 1996-2003 jGuru.com. All Rights Reserved.\\n\\nJava Basics -17\\n\\n\\x0cJava Basics\\n\\nsemantics, just as in C/C++. For example, i = j for two int variables i and j\\nperforms a 32-bit integer copy.\\n\\nAssignment of Objects\\n\\nAssignment makes two variables refer to the same object. For example,\\n\\nclass Data {\\n  public int data = 0;\\n  public Data(int d) { data = d; }\\n}\\n\\nI       Data a = new Data(1); // a.data is 1\\nI       Data b = new Data(2); // b.data is 2\\nII      b = a;                // b.data and a.data are 1\\nIII     a.data = 3;           // b.data and a.data are 3\\nIV      a = new Data(4);      // b.data is 3, a.data is 4\\n\\nTo copy objects, define and use clone():\\n\\nclass Data implements Cloneable {\\n  public int data = 0;\\n  public Data(int d) { data = d; }\\n  public Object clone() {\\n    Data d = (Data) super.clone();\\n    d.data = data;\\n    return d;\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n...\\n\\nData a = new Data(1); // a.data is 1\\nData b = new Data(2); // b.data is 2\\nb = a.clone();        // b.data and a.data are 1\\na.data = 3;           // b.data is 1, a.data is 3\\n\\nJava Basics -18\\n\\n© 1996-2003 jGuru.com. All Rights Reserved.\\n\\n\\x0cJava Basics\\n\\nNote: The above class definition requires exception handling code. We, however,\\nhave not yet discussed exception handling. For now, pretend that it is not\\nnecessary.\\n\\nMethod Parameters and Return Values\\n\\nArguments and return values for primitive types are passed by value to and from\\nall Java methods because they are implied assignments, as in C/C++. However, all\\nJava objects are passed by reference. For example, the C/C++ code:\\n\\n// C++ code\\n\\nint foo(int j) { return j + 34;}\\nButton *bfoo(Button *b) {\\n  if ( b != NULL ) return b;\\n  else return new Button();\\n}\\nor, in C\\n\\n/* C code */\\n\\nint foo(int j) { return j + 34;}\\nButton *bfoo(Button *b) {\\n  if ( b != NULL ) return b;\\n  else return calloc(sizeof(Button));\\n}\\nwould be written in the Java language:\\n\\n// Java code\\n\\nint foo(int j) { return j + 34;}\\nButton bfoo(Button b) {\\n  if ( b != null ) return b;\\n  else return new Button(\"OK\");\\n}\\n\\nEquality\\n\\nTwo Java primitive types are equal (using the == operator) when they have the\\nsame value (e.g., \"3 == 3\"). However, two object variables are equal if and only if\\nthey refer to the same instantiated object--a \"shallow\" comparison. For example,\\n\\nvoid test() {\\n  Data a = new Data(1);\\n  Data b = new Data(2);\\n  Data c = new Data(1);\\n  // a == b is FALSE\\n  // a == c is FALSE (in C++, this\\'d be TRUE)\\n\\n© 1996-2003 jGuru.com. All Rights Reserved.\\n\\nJava Basics -19\\n\\n\\x0cJava Basics\\n\\n  Data d = a;\\n  Data e = a;\\n  // d == e is TRUE,\\n  // d,e are referring to same object\\n}\\nTo perform a \"deep\" comparison, the convention is to define a method called\\nequals(). You would rewrite Data as:\\n\\nclass Data {\\n  public int data = 0;\\n  public Data(int d) { data = d; }\\n  boolean equals(Data d) {\\n    return data == d.data;\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n...\\n\\nData a = new Data(1);\\nData b = new Data(1);\\n// a.equals(b) is true!!!!\\n\\nNo Pointers!\\n\\nThe Java language does not have pointer types nor address arithmetic. Java\\nvariables are either primitive types or references to objects. To illustrate the\\ndifference between C/C++ and Java semantics, consider the following equivalent\\ncode fragments.\\n\\n// C++ code (C code would be similar)\\n\\nStack *s = new Stack; // point to a new Stack\\ns->push(...);\\n\\n// dereference and access method push()\\nThe equivalent Java code is:\\n\\n// Java code\\n\\n// internally, consider s to be a (Stack *)\\nStack s = new Stack();\\n// dereference s automatically\\ns.push(...);\\n\\nGarbage  Collection\\n\\nAn automatic garbage collector deallocates memory for objects that are no longer\\nneeded by your program, thereby relieving you from the tedious and error-prone\\n\\nJava Basics -20\\n\\n© 1996-2003 jGuru.com. All Rights Reserved.\\n\\n\\x0cJava Basics\\n\\ntask of deallocating your own memory.\\n\\nAs a consequence of automatic garbage collection and lack of pointers, a Java\\nobject is either null or valid--there is no way to refer to an invalid or stale object\\n(one that has been deallocated).\\n\\nTo illustrate the effect of a garbage collector, consider the following C++ function\\nthat allocates 1000 objects on the heap via the new operator (a similar C function\\nwould allocate memory using calloc/malloc):\\n\\n// C++ code\\n\\nvoid f() {\\n  T *t;\\n  for (int i = 1; i <= 1000; i++) {\\n    t = new T; // ack!!!!!\\n  }\\n}\\nEvery time the loop body is executed, a new instance of class T is instantiated, and\\nt is pointed to it. But what happens to the instance that t used to point to? It\\'s\\nstill allocated, but nothing points to it and therefore it\\'s inaccessible. Memory in\\nthis state is referred to as \"leaked\" memory.\\n\\nIn the Java language, memory leaks are not an issue. The following Java method\\ncauses no ill effects:\\n\\n// Java code\\n\\nvoid f() {\\n  T t;\\n  for (int i = 1; i <= 1000; i++) {\\n    t = new T();\\n  }\\n}\\nIn Java, each time t is assigned a new reference, the old reference is now available\\nfor garbage collection. Note that it isn\\'t immediately freed; it remains allocated\\nuntil the garbage collector thread is next executed and notices that it can be freed.\\n\\nPut simply, automatic garbage collection reduces programming effort,\\nprogramming errors, and program complexity.\\n\\n[MML: 0.995a]\\n[Version:  $Id:  //depot/main/src/edu/modules/JavaBasics/javaBasics.mml#3  $]\\n\\n© 1996-2003 jGuru.com.

(the latest versions of the netscapenavigator browser, for example, can run applets on virtually any platform).securitythe java language is secure in that it is very difficult to write incorrect code orviruses that can corrupt/steal your data, or harm hardware such as hard disks.there are two main lines of defense:! interpreter level:! no pointer arithmetic! garbage collection! array bounds checking! no illegal data conversions! browser level (applies to applets only):! no local file i/o! sockets back to host only! no calls to native methodsrobustnessthe java language is robust. it has several features designed to avoid crashesduring program execution, including:! no pointer arithmeticjava basics© 1996-2003 jguru.com. all rights reserved.java basics -3! garbage collection--no bad addresses! array and string bounds checking! no jumping to bad method addresses! interfaces and exceptionsjava program structurea file containing java source code is considered a compilation unit. such acompilation unit contains a set of classes and, optionally, a package definition togroup related classes together. classes contain data and method members thatspecify the state and behavior of the objects in your program.java programs come in two flavors:! standalone applications that have no initial context such as a pre-existing mainwindow! applets for www programmingthe major differences between applications and applets are:! applets are not allowed to use file i/o and sockets (other than to the hostplatform). applications do not have these restrictions.! an applet must be a subclass of the java applet class. aplications do not need tosubclass any particular class.! unlike applets, applications can have menus.! unlike applications, applets need to respond to predefined lifecycle messagesfrom the www browser in which they\\'re running.java program executionthe java byte-code compiler translates a java source file into machine-independent byte code. the byte code for each publicly visible class is placed in aseparate file, so that the java runtime system can easily find it. if your programinstantiates an object of class a, for example, the class loader searches thedirectories listed in your classpath environment variable for a file called a.classthat contains the class definition and byte code for class a.there is no link phase for java programs;

 }}the command java trivialapplication tells the java runtime system to beginwith the class file trivialapplication.class and to look in that file for amethod with the signature:public static void main(string args[]);the main() method will always reside in one of your class files. the javalanguage does not allow methods outside of class definitions. the class, in effect,creates scoped symbol startingclassname.main for your main() method.applet executionan applet is a java program that runs within a java-compatible www browser orin an appletviewer. to execute your applet, the browser:! creates an instance of your applet! sends messages to your applet to automatically invoke predefined lifecyclemethodsthe predefined methods automatically invoked by the runtime system are:! init(). this method takes the place of the applet constructor and is only calledonce during applet creation. instance variables should be initialized in this method.gui components such as buttons and scrollbars should be added to the gui inthis method.! start(). this method is called once after init() and whenever your applet isrevisited by your browser, or when you deiconify your browser. this methodshould be used to start animations and other threads.! paint(graphics g). this method is called when the applet drawing area needsto be redrawn. anything not drawn by contained components must be drawn inthis method. bitmaps, for example, are drawn here, but buttons are not becausethey handle their own painting.! stop(). this method is called when you leave an applet or when you iconifyyour browser. the method should be used to suspend animations and otherjava basicsjava basics -6© 1996-2003 jguru.com. all rights reserved.threads so they do not burden system resources unnecessarily. it is guaranteed tobe called before destroy().! destroy(). this method is called when an applet terminates, for example, whenquitting the browser. final clean-up operations such as freeing up systemresources with dispose() should be done here. the dispose() method of frameremoves the menu bar. therefore, do not forget to call super.dispose() if youoverride the default behavior.the basic structure of an applet that uses each of these predefined methods is:import java.applet.applet;// include all awt class definitionsimport java.awt.*;public class applettemplate extends applet {  public void init() {    // create gui, initialize applet  }  public void start() {    // start threads, animations etc...  }  public void paint(graphics g) {    // draw things in g  }  public void stop() {    // suspend threads, stop animations etc...  }  public void destroy() {    // free up system resources, stop threads  }}all you have to do is fill in the appropriate methods to bring your applet to life. ifyou don\\'t need to use one or more of these predefined methods, simply leave themout of your applet. the applet will ignore messages from the browser attemptingto invoke any of these methods that you don\\'t use.a simple appletthe following complete applet displays \"hello, world wide web!\" in yourbrowser window:import java.applet.applet;import java.awt.graphics;public class trivialapplet extends applet {  public void paint(graphics g) {    // display a string at 20,20java basics© 1996-2003 jguru.com. all rights reserved.java basics -7    // where 0,0 is the upper-left corner    g.drawstring(\"hello, world wide web!\", 20, 20);  }}an appletviewer may be used instead of a www browser to test applets. forexample, the output of trivialapplet on an appletviewer looks like:html/applet interfacethe html applet tag is similar to the html img tag, and has the form:<applet code=appletname.class width=w height=h>[parameters]</applet>where the optional parameters are a list of parameter definitions of the form:<param name=n value=v>an example tag with parameter definitions is:<applet code=appletname.class width=300 height=200><param name=p1 value=34><param name=p2 value=\"test\"></applet>where p1 and p2 are user-defined parameters.the code, width, and height parameters are mandatory. the parameterscodebase, alt, archives, align, vspace, and hspace are optional within the<applet> tag itself. your applet can access any of these parameters by calling:applet.getparameter(\"p\")which returns the string value of the parameter. for example, the applet:import java.applet.applet;public class paramtest extends applet {  public void init() {    system.out.println(\"width is \" + getparameter(\"width\"));    system.out.println(\"p1 is \"    + getparameter(\"p1\"));java basicsjava basics -8© 1996-2003 jguru.com. all rights reserved.    system.out.println(\"p2 is \"    + getparameter(\"p2\"));  }}prints the following to standard output:width is 300p1 is 34p2 is testcommentsjava comments are the same as c++ comments, i.e.,/* c-style block comments */where all text between the opening /* and closing */ is ignored, and// c++ style single-line commentswhere all text from the opening // to the end of the line is ignored.note that these two comments can make a very useful combination. c-stylecomments (/* ... */) cannot be nested, but can contain c++ style comments.this leads to the interesting observation that if you always use c++-stylecomments (// ...), you can easily comment out a section of code by surroundingit with c-style comments. so try to use c++ style comments for your \"normal\"code commentary, and reserve c-style comments for commenting out sections ofcode.the java language also has a document comment:/** document comment */these comments are processed by the javadoc program to generatedocumentation from your source code. for example,/** this class does blah blah blah */class blah {  /** this method does nothing  /**   * this is a multiple line comment.   * the leading * is not placed in documentation.   */  public void nothing() {;}}java basics© 1996-2003 jguru.com. all rights reserved.java basics -9declarationsa java variable may refer to an object, an array, or an item of primitive type.variables are defined using the following simple syntax:typename variablename;for example,int a;
